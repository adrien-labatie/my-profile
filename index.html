		<h1>ðŸ˜œHello, I'm AdrienðŸ˜‰</h1>
		<img src="images/profile-picture.png.png" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Adrien La Batie">
		<p>I love music, backpack trips, charity experiences and eating food. I am a bit curious, definitely adventurious but also sometimes grumpy. I always want to get out of my confort zone, and often take dumb decisions ; like learning chinese because ... why not ? or trying to have a discussion with a giraffe.</p>

		<h2>Music is my Religion</h2>
		<p>I have played Clarinette for more than 13 years, been able to play in incredible environment (like in the middle of the Vatican for the pope in front of more than 15000 people). I always have to listen to some music in any situation.</p>

		<h2>Backpack Trips</h2>
		<p>During the summer of 2018, i chose to leave my cosy french bed to start a backpack trip in south america. I have to admit that was my most incredible experience of all my life. From discovering new people, food... to loosing your backpack with literarily your life inside, this trip had everything from an action movie. Definitely something that a recommend for everyone out there.</p>

		<h2>Charity Works</h2>
		<p>Summer 2019. DAY 1 : left Paris for a village in the north-east of Namibia. DAY 2 : We have started to build the school. Why am i here, i'm dying, there is more than 50Â° all day, it is gonna take ages. DAY 3 : I've met that cool girl, i don't know her name, where she is from, why she is here ... actually ... i don't even know if that was a girl. DAY 4 : i send my farewell to my family, i'm sure of it, i'm dying. DAY 5 : i have just realized, i love couscous. DAY 6 : the girl's name from 2 days ago is wooly, no comments. Maybe her parents were drunk when the moment... i'm loosing myself.  </p>
